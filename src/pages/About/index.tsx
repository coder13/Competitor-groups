            This purpose of this website is to show WCA competition assignments. This site can show
            competing and staff assignments for competitions with 1 room or more for 1 day or
            multiday competitions updating with all of the competition&apos;s next round
            assignments. This site simply presents the assignments *as-is* from how they are, as
            stored on the WCA website.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Start times and end times are taken straight from the WCIF data as generated, rounded to
            the nearest 5 minutes, and converted to the respective venue&apos;s timezones.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            To get your competition&apos;s assignments to show here, you must generate them with a
            tool like <Link to="https://groupifier.jonatanklosko.com/">Groupifier</Link>,{' '}
