    timeLimits: <b>Time limits</b> are established for all rounds, applying to each individual solve. Solves that exceed the limit will be marked as "DNF" and the time will not count.
    cutoffs: Each round may include <bold>cutoffs</bold>, which dictate whether a competitor is eligible to complete all their attempts to finish their average. To qualify, they must achieve a time within the cutoff time during their initial solve or within their first two solves.
    cutoff: This round requires the condition met in the first attempt
    cutoff_other: This round requires the condition met in the first {{count}} attempts
    advancement:
      At least 25% of competitors must be eliminated before progressing to the next round. The
      organizing team will establish advancement criteria for each round, but adjustments may
      be necessary to ensure this minimum elimination threshold is met.

  title: About
  welcome: Welcome to CompetitionGroups.com!
  purpose: This purpose of this website is to show WCA competition assignments. This site can show
    competing and staff assignments for competitions with 1 room or more for 1 day or
    multiday competitions updating with all of the competition's next round
    assignments. This site simply presents the assignments *as-is* from how they are, as
    stored on the WCA website.
  startTimes:
    Start times and end times are taken straight from the WCIF data as generated, rounded to
    the nearest 5 minutes, and converted to the respective venue's timezones.
  competitionAssignments:
    To get your competition's assignments to show here, you must generate them with a
    tool like <3 to="https://groupifier.jonatanklosko.com/">Groupifier</3>,
    <6 to="https://delegate-dashboard.netlify.app/">DelegateDashboard</6>, or
    <9 to="https://goosly.github.io/AGE/">AGE</9>.
  developer: If you are a developer and you want to learn more about the data that is shown here, check out the <2 to="https://github.com/thewca/wcif/blob/master/specification.md">WCIF specification</2>.
  peopleCanBe:
    People can be assigned to groups, rounds, or any arbitrary activity. If you want to get
    creative with the website, feel free to <2 to="https://github.com/coder13">reach out to me</2>!
disclaimerText: Start times are subject to change and may run ahead or behind schedule. Check with competition organizers for updates.
