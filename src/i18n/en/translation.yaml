    timeLimits: <b>Time limits</b> are established for all rounds, applying to each individual solve. Solves that exceed the limit will be marked as &quot;DNF&quot; and the time will not count.
    cutoffs: Each round may include <bold>cutoffs</bold>, which dictate whether a competitor is eligible to complete all their attempts to finish their average. To qualify, they must achieve a time within the cutoff time during their initial solve or within their first two solves.
    cutoff: This round requires the condition met in the first {{count}} attempt
    cutoff_other: This round requires the condition met in the first {{count}} attempts
    advancement:

      organizing team will establish advancement criteria for each round, but adjustments may
      be necessary to ensure this minimum elimination threshold is met.
